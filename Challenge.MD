# Intern Hiring Challenge

Welcome to the hiring challenge! This challenge is designed to assess your ability to work with a real-world project, follow setup instructions, and demonstrate your work.

## 📝 Instructions

### 1. Fork the Project

Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Local Setup

Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` file to get the project running. This includes:

*   Installing all dependencies.
*   Setting up your own Firebase project and connecting it to the application. You will need to create your own `firebaseConfig.ts` with your credentials and add the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files.

### 3. Demonstrate Your Work

Once you have the application running successfully on your local machine (either on a simulator/emulator or a physical device), record a short video of the app running. The video should clearly show the app launching and some of its basic functionality.

### 4. Create a Pull Request

Create a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repository to the `main` branch of this original repository.

In the description of your Pull Request, please include:

*   A link to the demo video you recorded. You can upload the video to a service like Loom, YouTube, or Google Drive and share the public link.
*   A brief summary of your experience with the setup process. Mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

We look forward to seeing your submission. Good luck!
